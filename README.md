This tool has 3 options 
1- Arrange Files in the same folder only.
2- Arrange Files in folders thats inside main folder.
3- Arrange Files in folder into separate folders.
```
<h5>This tool works only when you use Youtube-dl to download courses from Pluralsight.</h5>

<h4>How it works :</h4>
```
first we loop through each file and take first part and create folder with this name,
then we move files to folders thats have the same name.
then rename each file and take the number of file from the end of file to the first of file then we remove repeated names in file name.

```
